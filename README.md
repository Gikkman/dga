Distributed Genetic Algorithm

This is the project I wrote for my bachelor's thesis at University of Sk√∂vde, Sweden in 2015.

At the moment, the code is missing. I must've deleted it for some reason... I'll get to re-upload it shortly. I just had access to the compiled product and a few TSPLIB problems at the moment, so they'll have to do till I can upload the rest of the project again.

USAGE
The application is relativley self-explanatory. The user has to select a problem from the TSPLIB library and a valid output file. Set all the algorithm's variables and press RUN.
